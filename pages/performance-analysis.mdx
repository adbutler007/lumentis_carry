# Performance Analysis

In this section, we dive deep into the performance of futures carry strategies across various dimensions. Our analysis covers:

- Sector-specific carry strategies
- Carry strategies applied to the full universe of liquid futures
- Scenario analysis to assess carry performance in adverse market conditions
- The potential benefits of stacking carry alongside traditional assets

Through this multi-faceted approach, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how carry strategies behave and the value they can add to investor portfolios.

<Steps>

### Step 1

We begin by examining the performance of carry strategies within each futures sector. This granular analysis allows us to identify sector-specific nuances and uncover the most promising areas for carry-based investing. 

### Step 2

Next, we broaden our scope to the full universe of liquid futures contracts. By allowing markets to compete for allocation based on their carry characteristics, we can construct more efficient portfolios that capitalize on the most attractive carry opportunities at any given time.

</Steps>

To optimize our carry strategies, we explore various portfolio construction techniques, including:

- Inverse volatility weighting
- Mean-variance optimization
- Beta-neutrality constraints

By comparing the performance of these approaches, we gain insights into the most effective ways to harness the power of carry while managing risk.

We also conduct rigorous scenario analysis to stress-test our carry strategies in challenging market environments. By examining carry returns during the worst periods for stocks and bonds, as well as major market drawdowns, we can assess the diversification potential and resilience of carry-based investing.

Finally, we showcase the benefits of [stacking](/performance-analysis/stacking-case-studies) carry alongside traditional assets like stocks and bonds. Our case studies demonstrate how adding a carry strategy to a conventional portfolio can enhance returns and improve overall risk-adjusted performance.
