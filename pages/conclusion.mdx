# Conclusion

The exploration of futures carry strategies within this study illuminates the nuanced and multifaceted nature of carry as a source of potential returns across various asset classes. Through a meticulous examination of carry and its manifestations in equities, bonds, commodities, and currencies, we have endeavored to dissect the economic rationale underpinning carry returns, thereby offering a granular understanding of its potential role in portfolio optimization.

Our analysis, spanning over three decades, leverages a comprehensive dataset to delve into the intricacies of carry, employing both classic and relative value approaches to capture the essence of carry across a diverse range of market conditions. The methodologies employed—ranging from simple [cross-sectional](/performance-analysis/sector-carry-strategies) and [time series strategies](/performance-analysis/carry-on-the-full-liquid-futures-universe) to more sophisticated [ensemble](/performance-analysis/carry-on-the-full-liquid-futures-universe/inverse-volatility-weighted-portfolios) and [optimized portfolio constructions](/performance-analysis/carry-on-the-full-liquid-futures-universe/optimized-portfolios)—reveal the dynamic interplay between carry signals and market behavior, highlighting the importance of adaptability in strategy formulation.

The comparative analysis of [inverse volatility weighted](/performance-analysis/carry-on-the-full-liquid-futures-universe/inverse-volatility-weighted-portfolios) and [optimized portfolios](/performance-analysis/carry-on-the-full-liquid-futures-universe/optimized-portfolios) underscores the significance of accounting for market correlations, which, when ignored, may inadvertently skew portfolio allocations. Moreover, the introduction of [constraints to neutralize exposure](/performance-analysis/carry-on-the-full-liquid-futures-universe/constrained-portfolios) to key market benchmarks such as the S&amp;P 500 and U.S. Treasury futures further refines the approach, aiming to deliver a more balanced and risk-aware portfolio composition.

It is imperative to acknowledge that the performance of carry strategies, as detailed in this study, is presented on a gross basis, with a subsequent examination of [net returns after accounting for estimated trading costs](/performance-analysis/carry-on-the-full-liquid-futures-universe/gross-versus-net-returns). This distinction is crucial, as it highlights the operational efficiencies achievable through trade netting and weight smoothing, which may mitigate the impact of transaction costs on overall returns.

In conclusion, while the empirical evidence presented herein suggests that futures carry strategies may contribute positively to portfolio performance, it is essential to approach these findings with a measured perspective. The potential benefits of carry must be weighed against the inherent risks and uncertainties characteristic of financial markets. Investors are encouraged to consider carry strategies as part of a broader, diversified investment approach, always mindful of the dynamic and evolving nature of market conditions. 

This study, by dissecting the complexities of carry and its practical application in portfolio management, aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on investment strategy optimization. As markets continue to evolve, so too will the strategies employed by investors to navigate them. Carry, with its foundational role in the economic underpinnings of asset returns, remains a compelling area for further exploration and potential inclusion in the sophisticated investor's toolkit.
