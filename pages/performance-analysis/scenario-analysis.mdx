# Scenario Analysis

Carry strategies have demonstrated strong performance across various market conditions, but investors are often most interested in how they behave during adverse scenarios. In this section, we dive deep into the performance of carry during the worst periods for traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds.

<Callout type="info">
Examining carry returns during challenging environments provides valuable insight into its diversification potential and ability to enhance portfolios.
</Callout>

We analyze carry strategy returns:
- During the worst quarterly returns for the S&P 500 and Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Indices
- Over the course of the most severe stock and bond market drawdowns in recent decades

By stress testing carry in this manner, we aim to give investors greater confidence in its role as a portfolio diversifier.

## [Carry in the Worst Benchmark Quarters](/performance-analysis/scenario-analysis/carry-in-the-worst-benchmark-quarters) 

In this subsection, we sort quarterly returns for stocks and bonds into quintiles, and evaluate how carry and trend following performed in the worst 20% of periods for each asset class.

## [Carry During Benchmark Drawdowns](/performance-analysis/scenario-analysis/carry-during-benchmark-drawdowns)

Here we plot the cumulative returns of carry against those of stocks and bonds during the largest drawdowns for each, demonstrating how carry has historically achieved "crisis alpha".

### Step 1

Review carry strategy returns during the worst performing quarters for stocks and bonds

### Step 2 

Analyze carry's ability to provide positive returns during the largest stock and bond drawdowns in history

</Steps>

The evidence presented highlights that thoughtfully constructed carry strategies have the potential to deliver strong diversification benefits when investors need them most. By generating positive returns during severe market dislocations, carry may help investors mitigate left-tail risk in their portfolios.
