# Stacking Case Studies

The concept of return stacking, or combining uncorrelated return streams to enhance risk-adjusted performance, is a core principle of modern portfolio construction. Given the diversifying properties of carry demonstrated in the prior section, and the well documented low correlation of managed futures trend to major indices, we now explore the potential benefits of stacking carry and trend strategies on top of traditional stock and bond allocations.

[Figure 28](#fig:ivv_stacks) shows the cumulative growth of the S&amp;P 500 and hypothetical portfolios investing 100 percent in the S&amp;P 500 and collateralizing carry and trend strategies stacked on top. In simulation, stacking carry and/or trend on top of U.S. equities produced substantial performance gains with minimal excess volatility, and the potential for similar or smaller drawdowns.

[Figure 29](#fig:agg_stacks) conducts the same hypothetical analysis for the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index. The improvement in simulated performance is even more striking, with the stacked bond portfolio delivering large boosts in returns with minimal impact on drawdowns. The 2022 bond drawdown is also significantly reduced in simulation by the strong positive returns to carry and trend during this challenging period for fixed income.

[Figure 30](#fig:perf_stacks) summarizes the hypothetical return stacking results, showing that carry and trend each may have the potential to add material excess return to the underlying asset class while maintaining a low correlation and beta. The impact is particularly meaningful for bonds in simulation.

These case studies demonstrate the potential for carry and trend to enhance traditional portfolios. By stacking uncorrelated risk premia across global futures markets
