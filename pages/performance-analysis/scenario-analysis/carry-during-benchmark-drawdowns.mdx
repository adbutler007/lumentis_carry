# Carry During Benchmark Drawdowns

While the [quintile analysis](/performance-analysis/scenario-analysis/carry-in-the-worst-benchmark-quarters) is informative, investors are often most concerned with performance during extended drawdowns rather than single quarter returns. To address this, Figure 22 to Figure 24 plot the cumulative excess return of the final Carry (Net) Strategy and S&P 500 futures during the three worst drawdowns for the S&P 500 Total Return Index. Figure 25 to Figure 27 do the same for U.S. 10Y Treasury futures conditioned on quarterly quintile returns of the Bloomberg Barclays 7-10 Year Government Bond Total Return Index [koijen2018carry](Koijen et al. 2018) [moskowitz2012time](Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen 2012) [baz2015dissecting](Baz et al. 2015).

Carry mostly shrugged off the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 (Figure 22) and the 'Tech Wreck' following the late 1990s technology and telecom bubble (Figure 23), demonstrating a perhaps surprising ability to provide "crisis alpha". The Carry Strategy also held in relatively well in the fastest and most severe equity drawdown during COVID (Figure 24).

The bond drawdown analysis is particularly relevant given the historic losses in fixed income in 2022. Figure 25 shows that carry was mostly resilient during this period, and returns to carry almost perfectly mirror returns to bonds for most of this inflationary shock. Despite the Carry Strategy's attempts at neutralizing beta to Treasuries, strategy returns have been mixed in the other two worst Treasury market drawdowns, with one positive and one slightly negative result over relatively short horizons.

Taken together, the scenario analysis suggests that futures carry strategies can play a unique role in investor portfolios, providing meaningful returns and diversification during precisely the periods where traditional asset classes suffer the most. By generating crisis alpha, carry can help investors hedge left-tail risk and smooth portfolio drawdowns.
