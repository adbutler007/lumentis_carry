# Analytical Framework

Our analysis seeks to provide a comprehensive examination of the performance of futures carry strategies across multiple dimensions:

- Carry definition: classic and relative value carry
- Different transforms on the raw carry signals
- Simple cross-sectional and time series carry strategies
- Sector and total portfolio level
- Several layers of ensembles
- Naive vs optimized portfolios
- Impact of certain practical constraints

By exploring carry strategies from various angles, we aim to gain a robust understanding of their potential role in portfolio optimization.

It is useful to examine carry signals both in absolute terms and in relation to any long-term biases in the carry structure of a market ([Koijen et al. 2018](/references); [Baltas 2017](/references); [Baz et al. 2015](/references)). For example, some markets have a structural negative (gold) or positive (bonds) carry, but this does not lead to constant negative (positive) returns because investors demand (supply) the asset for other reasons.

Carry relative value, therefore, is defined as the z-score of a market's carry over 1, 3, 5, 10 years and since-inception historical rolling windows. This approach normalizes the carry signal by its historical volatility:

$\text{Carry Relative Value} = \frac{\text{Current Carry} - \text{Mean Historical Carry}}{\text{Standard Deviation of Historical Carry}}$

where:
- $\text{Current Carry}$ is the carry calculated for the current period,
- $\text{Mean Historical Carry}$ is the average carry over a specified historical period,
- $\text{Standard Deviation of Historical Carry}$ is the standard deviation of carry over the same historical period.

In all instances, the z-score value for a market on each of the lookbacks are averaged to provide a final carry z-score signal for each day. 

For both carry and carry z-score methods, we build carry strategies from the ground up, starting with sectors and then integrating the full target universe.

We explore the use of raw carry and carry z-score as signals, along with a quasi-'binary' transform of each score as either 1 or -1 for markets with positive or negative values, respectively. We also employ a rescaled ranking transform, where assets with positive carry scores are assigned positive ranks ordinally on carry score, while those with negative scores receive negative ranks. These transforms are applied cross-sectionally each day across all markets in the target universe. For example, at the sector level the transforms are applied cross-sectionally to markets in each sector. At the full universe level they're applied across the full universe of markets.

## Portfolio Construction

The details of portfolio construction methodologies, including naive and optimized approaches, will be covered in the [Portfolio Construction](/experimental-design/analytical-framework/portfolio-construction) subsection.
