# Experimental Design

In this section, we dive into the nitty-gritty details of our study, providing a comprehensive overview of the data, methodology, and analytical framework employed. Our aim is to ensure transparency and reproducibility, allowing readers to gain a deep understanding of the research process.

We begin by discussing the [data](/experimental-design/data) used in our analysis, focusing on the futures price data across various asset classes and the criteria for inclusion in our study. Next, we delve into the specifics of [calculating carry](/experimental-design/calculating-carry) for each sector, addressing the nuances and challenges involved.

Finally, we present our [analytical framework](/experimental-design/analytical-framework), a multi-dimensional approach to assessing carry strategy performance. This framework encompasses a range of methodologies, from simple cross-sectional and time-series strategies to more sophisticated ensemble and optimized portfolio constructions.
