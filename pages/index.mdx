# What is Carry?

While investors generally prefer to sell investments for more than they purchased them for, price appreciation is not the only source of returns. Landlords, for example, can earn rental income, seeking to generate income in excess of costs associated with owning property.

This second source of return is called the expected yield or "carry," and can be loosely defined as the expected return of an investment assuming no change in its price. More thoroughly, carry is the economic benefit that one might expect to achieve by holding – or "carrying" – a particular investment minus the costs associated with holding it. Carry strategies seek to maximize exposure to this second component of returns.

We believe carry is a pertinent feature of all markets and a key driver of returns, allowing systematic carry strategies to serve as a cornerstone of a well-diversified portfolio. While carry is almost always an _expectation_ about what will happen in the future - after all, tenants do not always make due on their rents! - we will mostly omit the 'expected' modifier going forward, for simplicity.

By dissecting carry and its practical application in portfolio management, we aim to demonstrate its potential to enhance risk-adjusted returns as part of a broader, diversified investment approach. In the following sections, we will dive deeper into the data, methodology and results of our investigation into futures carry strategies.
