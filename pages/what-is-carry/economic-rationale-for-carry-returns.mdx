# Economic Rationale for Carry Returns

Given that carry signals are explicitly measuring a component of expected returns, one possible explanation for the returns of carry strategies is that it is the compensation for an investor's willingness to bear some form of risk, or a portion of embedded costs. In corporate bonds, for example, investors will demand higher yields when expected defaults – a significant driver of price returns – increase <a href="/references/">(Ilmanen 2011)</a>. Additionally, carry premia may be related to time-varying inflation risk, as changes in inflation expectations can impact asset prices and the returns to carry strategies <a href="/references/">(Boons et al. 2020)</a>.

We explore potential economic reasons for carry to exist in various asset classes below.

- **Equity:** If equity carry is a compensation for a fundamental risk, it follows that equity indices with a higher expected dividend yield – or, more comprehensively, shareholder yield – must be fundamentally riskier. Given dividend yield's similarity to signals used within equity value investing, we might expect the return (and drivers) of an equity carry strategy to correlate to the equity value premium.

- **Government Bonds:** Term spreads should compensate long-term bond holders for illiquidity risk, monetary policy risk and inflation risk.

- **Commodities:** According to <a href="/references/">(Baltas 2017)</a>, "the theory of 'normal backwardation' suggests that commodity producers take short futures positions in order to hedge against price drops and therefore pay a premium to an investor that offers this insurance and takes a long position in the futures contract." One can make the case that commodity producers benefit from hedging the sale price of production forward because the asset owners who provide capital for their operations will agree to better terms with the knowledge that the sale price is locked in. There are also costs to inventory commodities, so the carrying costs implied in financial futures on the commodity should reflect these costs. These and other dynamics contribute to positive or negative carry dynamics in different commodites over time.

- **Currencies:** <a href="/references/">(Baltas 2017)</a> suggests that higher short rates are generally "associated with rising inflation, funding liquidity concerns, or consumption growth risk, which render higher-yielding currencies more vulnerable," necessitating a higher interest rate. Thus, currency carry has historically played out with investors funding higher yielding emerging market currencies by borrowing in lower yielding developed market currencies, especially the Japanese Yen and the U.S. dollar.

While carry may compensate for some form of risk, or embedded cost in each asset class, precisely identifying and measuring these risks is challenging. As a result, carry strategies may at times deliver "crisis alpha", generating positive returns in periods where the compensation for these risks is not required. This is explored further in the [Scenario Analysis](/performance-analysis/scenario-analysis) section.
